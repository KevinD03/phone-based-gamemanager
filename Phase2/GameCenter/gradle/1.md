Assume the DFA that accept LR4 has 8 states.
Since ∑ = {a,b,c}, there are 9 ways to construct a length = 2 prefixes {aa,ab,ac,ba,bb,bc,ca,cb,cc}pick a pair of distinct length = 2 prefixes of strings in LR4
and check if they could drive the machine to the same state. So, we will have 36 cases to consider since 9C2 = 36. If none of these 36 cases can drive the machine the same state. Then our assumption will be false.

Case1: ‘aa’ and ‘ab’
        If we want 'aa' to be accepted, then the last two places of the string should be 'aa' as well. However, when we set ‘aa’ as the last two place of the string, it becomes ‘abaa’, and it will not be accepted. Therefore, in this case, 2 distinct length2 prefixes ‘aa’ and ‘ab’ can not drive the machine to the same state.

Case2: ‘aa’ and ‘ba’
        If we want 'aa' to be accepted, then the last two places of the string should be 'aa' as well.
